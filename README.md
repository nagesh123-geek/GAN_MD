# GAN_MD
This repository contains the GAN models developed for Molecular dynamics data for four systems of study, viz, two dimesnional Brownian Motion in three well potential
Protein Ligand distance trajectory , Trp cage mini protein and alphasynuclein.

# Training and Sampling 
Training and sampling script for various systems are provided in the respective folders

# Data 

In data section , we provided the data for toy two dimensional three well potential Brownian Dynamics for user reproducability.
